## If/Elif/Else Conditional Statements
Used for decision-making operations with conditions

Conditional statements always start with an
`if` header
`elif` optional, but we can have as many as we want
`else` optional, but only 1 for every `if`

### Condition:
An expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value (AKA. Boolean expression) 

### Indentation:
Python relies on indentation to define scope in the code

### Formula:
if (Condition):
> Body Statement

elif (Condition):
> Body Statement

else (Condition):
> Body Statement

*Ex. *
```

a = 2

if (a == 0):
 print("hi")
else:
 print("bye")
```

> bye
