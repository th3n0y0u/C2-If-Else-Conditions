## If/Elif/Else Conditional Statements
Used for decision-making operations with conditions

Conditional statements always start with an
`if` header
`elif` optional, but we can have as many as we want
`else` optional, but only 1 for every `if`

### Condition:
An expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value (AKA. Boolean expression) 

### Indentation:
Python relies on indentation to define scope in the code

### Formula:
if (Condition):
> Body Statement

elif (Condition):
> Body Statement

else (Condition):
> Body Statement

*Ex. *
```

a = 2

if (a == 0):
 print("hi")
else:
 print("bye")
```

> bye

## Nested Conditio nal Statements

A conditional statement inside another conditional statement

### Indentation

The header/clause of a nested conditional statement must be indented from a outer header

### Formula:

```
if(Condition):
 if(Condition): <-- Starting a nested statement
    Body Statement
 elif(Condition):
  Body Statement
 else:
  Body Statement <-- End of nested statement
elif(Condition):
 Body Statement
else:
 Body Statement
```

*Ex.*

```
x = 10
y = 10
if(x < y):
 print("x is less than y")
else:
 if(x > y):
   print("x is greater than y")
 else:
   print("x and y must be equal")
```
> x and y must be equal
